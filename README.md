1. The only edited files are main.cpp and CurvatureMesh.h.
2. Build a new project with the same relative path of "MeshLib", "CurvatureMesh" and the file, main.cpp.
3. I don't think my code is very compact and efficient. Specifically, there must be some easier ways to trace boundaries. But I didn't go through all Gu's codes for which reason I only use the most basic part of the data structure in his codes when implementing boundary tracing.
